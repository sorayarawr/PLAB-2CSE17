What is code complexity (time and space)?
    time complexity =! actual time 
    ^^ it tells the behaviour of the code, as a function based on number of inputs.
    best- Omega
    Worst- Big-O
    Average- Theta

    Constant time complexity = O(1) ----> best complexity
    Logarithmic = O(Log n) -----> generally used for Binary Search/ BST
    Linear time complexity = O(n) -----> Simple for loops
    O(n log n) ----> used in all kinds of sorting, generally
    Quadratic = O(n^2) ----> Generally try to avoid ts, used in nested loops
    Exponential = O(2^n) -----> Recursive functions!
    O(n!) -----> THE worst shit possible lmao :skull:
