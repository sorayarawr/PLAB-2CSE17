What is code complexity (time and space)?
    Time complexity describes how the running time of a program increases with the size of the input.
    time complexity =! actual time 
    ^^ it tells the behaviour of the code, as a function based on number of inputs.
    best- Omega
    Worst- Big-O
    Average- Theta

    Constant time complexity = O(1) ----> best complexity
    Logarithmic = O(Log n) -----> generally used for Binary Search/ BST
    Linear time complexity = O(n) -----> Simple for loops
    O(n log n) ----> used in all kinds of sorting, generally
    Quadratic = O(n^2) ----> Generally try to avoid ts, used in nested loops
    Exponential = O(2^n) -----> Recursive functions!
    O(n!) -----> THE worst shit possible lmao :skull:


    Space Complexity! ----> depends on auxiliary memory (aside from the inputs)
    describes how much extra memory a program uses as the input size grows

why python?
    because it's f l e x i b l e 

Datatypes and Variables!


print(True or False and False)
---> False

x = [0, 1, 2]
y = x
y[0] = 5
print(x[0])
---> answer is 5, 
    because y=x only makes y point to X, and does NOT make a copy of X on Y
